IMv7 Command Line Interface re-design...

I have added a CLI interface of ImageMagick as part of version 7 development.
Yes I am on the very small development team for this.  This will let the
software become more script-like, and you will be able to use a script rather
than VERY VERY LONG COMMAND LINES.   That is the current norm.

See  ImageMagick Examples...
   http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/
Specifically Basic Usage, Working Example
   http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/basics/#example
And that is a 'small' command line.

You will still be able to use commands as you always have, but you will also
be able to script those commands, using files or pipelines.

As part of this I am also going to ensure that you can run ImageMagick as
a co-processor.  That is run Imagemagick in background with image processing
options being sent to it from a wrapper program (shell or any other language).

The background ImageMagick command, will read/process/write the images,
holding the images in memory for as long as needed, report information about
them, all according to the instructions it recieves.

The wrapping program (shell, PHP, or other) can ask for images to be read in,
request information about them, sent processing options based on that
information (feedback loop).  The wrapper thus provides the if-then, looping,
and function handling aspects, while letting ImageMagick do what it does best,
handle images.

The real point is to remove having to run multiple image processing commands,
where it spends all its time simply reading and writing intermediate images,
that are being passed between multiple commands (via pipelines or disk files).
Instead the images are just kept in memory for as long as it is needed.
Making shell script image processing very much faster.

UPDATE: Cristy added the ability to use a remote 'image caching service'.

It does not need to be shell, but could be PHP (using its proc_open()
function), or any other language,  but it will be designed with shell
scripting in mind!

---

"magick" -- The replacement "convert" command.

Its usage will be either like IMv6 "convert"
    magick [options|images]... [output]

Or as a "scripting" command
    magick [options] -script scriptname [script_arguments]

or for basic information (and abort) options...
    magick -version
    magick -list listtype

Note using -version or -list within a "script" will work as expected, but will
not abort the image processing as the above does, which allows you to use
these options in a co-processing (parent process controlled) technique, as
part of the making decisions as to how to process images.

Also "magick" will have a much more strict option processing order. As such if
you don't have an image in memory when you try to process the image you will
get an error.

The big change is the "-script" option that will switch to reading options
from given file, file descriptor, or pipeline (stdin).  It will also provide
a simple 'CLI' interface, where you can type options in directly.

---

Scripting Details...

Script Launching (command line only)

   -script {script_file}   # argument for script files


This means you can create "magick scripts" of the form...

   #!/path/to/magick -script
   #
   # This is a Magick Script
   #
   -read granite: ( rose: -rotate 180 )
   -gravity center -composite  -write show:

If the "magick" command is named "magick-script" as a single word, then
the "-script" option will be assumed. This will allow you to run a
"magick script" using rather well known "env" program trick...

   #!/usr/bin/env magick-script
   #
   -pointsize 48 label:'Magick with "env"'
   -write show:

In this form of she-bang ("#!"), only one argument can follow the "env"
command, which is why more compact form of the command ("magick-script") is
needed.  Actually this will work if "magick" is named (copied, symlinked, or
hard linked) any command that ends with the string "script".

The script file is parsed in a way that is very close to that of a bash
script.  In fact you should be able to copy the CLI arguments into a script
file, and prepend "-write" to the last argument, so as get exactly the same
result.

EG: This IMv6 command...

   convert rose: -scale 200% big_rose.png

can be converted directly to this IMv7 "magick" command...

   magick rose: -scale 200% big_rose.png

Or to a magick script... (no shell pasing of arguments IM does that parsing)

   #!/path/to/magick -script
   rose: -scale 200% -write big_rose.png

You can even 'pipe' the otpions into the magick command...

   echo "rose: -scale 200% -write big_rose.png" |
      magick -script -

Each argument (token) in the script consists of a white-space separated words.
And you can escape characters using backslashes '\', single quotes ''' or
double quotes '"' in exactly the same way as bash does.  Any '#' that is the
start of a word (token) starts a comment to the end of the line and is
ignored.

This means if something 'works' for a bash "echo", then it should work the
same way in a magick script.  For example

    prompt> echo abc#123
    abc#123

Which shows the shell did not see '#' as the start of a comment, so neither
will the "magick" command when it interprets a "magick script".

For example each of the following produces a single character 'word'
exactly as you would if you had used them in a shell "echo" command.

    \# '#' "#"  -  \'  "'"  -  \"  '"'  "\""  -  \\  '\'  "\\"

These are all the special meta-characters handled by "magick".

The other bash meta-characters (namely:  $ ` ( ) { } [ ] ; ! > < * ? )
are not handled in any special way by "magick".  They are just ordinary
characters and as such they do not need escaping.  However escaping them does
not hurt!

---

Parsing Details  (extract from  "MagickWand/script-token.c" documentation)

The input stream is dived into individual 'tokens' (representing 'words' or
'options'), in a way that is as close to a UNIX shell, as is feasable.
Only shell variable, and command substitutions will not be performed.
Tokens can be any length.

The main function call is GetScriptToken() (see below) which returns one
and only one token at a time.  The other functions provide support to this
function, opening scripts, and seting up the required structures.

More specifically...

Tokens are white space separated, and may be quoted, or even partially
quoted by either single or double quotes, or the use of backslashes,
or any mix of the three.

For example:    This\ is' a 'single" token"

A token is returned immediatally the end of token is found. That is as soon
as a unquoted white-space or EOF condition has been found.  That is to say
the file stream is parsed purely character-by-character, regardless any
buffering constraints set by the system.  It is not parsed line-by-line.

The function will return 'MagickTrue' if a valid token was found, while
the token status will be set accordingally to 'OK' or 'EOF', according to
the cause of the end of token.  The token may be an empty string if the
input was a quoted empty string.  Other error conditions return a value of
MagickFalse, indicating any token found but was incomplete due to some
error condition.

Single quotes will preserve all characters including backslashes. Double
quotes will also preserve backslashes unless escaping a double quote,
or another backslashes.  Other shell meta-characters are not treated as
special by this tokenizer.

For example Quoting the quote chars:
            \'  "'"       \"  '"'  "\""      \\  '\'  "\\"

Outside quotes, backslash characters will make spaces, tabs and quotes part
of a token returned. However a backslash at the end of a line (and outside
quotes) will cause the newline to be completely ignored (as per the shell
line continuation).

Comments start with a '#' character at the start of a new token, will be
completely ignored upto the end of line, regardless of any backslash at the
end of the line.  You can escape a comment '#', using quotes or backlsashes
just as you can in a shell.

The parser will accept both newlines, returns, or return-newlines to mark
the EOL. Though this is technically breaking (or perhaps adding to) the
'BASH' syntax that is being followed.


UNIX script Launcher...

The use of '#' comments allow normal UNIX 'scripting' to be used to call on
the "magick" command to parse the tokens from a file

  #!/path/to/command/magick -script


UNIX 'env' command launcher...

If "magick" is renamed "magick-script" you can use a 'env' UNIX launcher

  #!/usr/bin/env magick-script


Shell script launcher...

As a special case a ':' at the start of a line is also treated as a comment
This allows a magick script to ignore a line that can be parsed by the shell
and not by the magick script (tokenizer).  This allows for an alternative
script 'launcher' to be used for magick scripts.

  #!/bin/sh
  :; exec magick -script "$0" "$@"; exit 10
  #
  # The rest of the file is magick script
  -read label:"This is a Magick Script!"
  -write show: -exit

r with some shell pre/post processing...

  #!/bin/sh
  :; echo "This part is run in the shell, but ignored by Magick"
  :; magick -script "$0" "$@"
  :; echo "This is run after the "magick" script is finished!"


--------------
Script option Handling

We have alreay seen the Script Launching option...

   -script {script_file}   # argument for script files

But you can use -script as a sort of 'complex sub-routine' call
For example...

   magick  input_image.png \
           -script make_fancy.mgk \
           -script shadow.mgk \
           output_image.png


Other IMv7 specific scripting options...
These are generally only useful within a "magick script"

   -exit          # Exit the file or pipeline being processed (quit).
                  # It is equivelent to reaching the end of the script.
                  # After this option nothing more is read from the script
                  # file or the command line.

   -read "image_file"       # equivelent to just "image_file" on it own.

WARNING: ---- the rest have yet to be implemented ----

   -return        # Return execution back to the original option process.
                  # If the return is to CLI, it will be at a point after
                  # the "-script" option and last -args script processed.
                  # Equivelent to -exit if the last CLI argument was used.
                  # The last argument will again be regarded as the final
                  # output filename.

   -reset         # Delete all images and reset settings.
                  # Basically prepare for completely new image process,
                  # except for perhaps user-defined global defines,
                  # and a reset of the image cache.

   -debug ???     # trace each command as it is processed by the "magick"
                  # script returning (some) signal when it is done.
                  # This may be a 'trace' or other logging setting instead.

   -define-setting {key}    # expand percent escapes found in this global
                            # define (artifact) and save as a per-image
                            # setting (property) to each image in the current
                            # image sequence.

   -fatal-level {level}     # level is 'fatal' 'error' 'warning'  (def: 'error')
                            # replaces -regard-warning IMv6 option
                            # so as to provide more control over when "magick"
                            # aborts its processing of a command, and allow
                            # it to vary during processing.

Argument Handling (script or pipeline only)

Note that -args can NOT be used on the command line, as any other place
really does not make much sense!

   -args ReadNextImage      # read the next argument as a image filename
   -args ReadAllImages      # read all arguments as images (except last)

   -args ReadLastImage      # read the last argument as a input image
   -args WriteLastImage     # write current images using last argument

   -args DefineGlobal {key} # Read next argument string as a global define
                            # for {key}.  that is  {key}={value_from_arg}
                            # Basically freeform 'argument input'

   -args Process            # process all later args, much like "montage" does.
                            # Up to either a '--' or end or arguments.
                            # Only last argument is ignored (for later write)

Notes:
  * -args will only work if -script is called from CLI.  They can not be used
    within a script that was called by another script (if made posible)
  * "-args Process" will permit normal "convert"-like argument processing
    of the remaining arguments, up to a special '--' symbol.  After those
    arguments are processed the script itself will continue where it left off.
    It will not cause an error (just ignored) if used from -script called from
    a script, in which case it is assumed images are already pre-processed.

NOTE: No 'flow-control' operators are provided at this time.  If you want
more control (such as if-then or looping) create a wrapper script around
a "ImageMagick" co-processor, and feed it the operations you want it to
perform (see below).

----

Example a 'montage'-like ImageMagick script...
Setup, process user image processing options, finish up and write results

    filename: "my_montage_script"
    =======8<--------
    #!/usr/env magick -script
    #
    # set defaults before processing user supplied images.
    -density 300

    # process all user supplied command line options (like-convert) now
    # This also read in any images the user may have supplied.
    -args Process

    # finish processing, adding frames and appending the resulting images
    -frame 6x6+2+2 -border 2x2 -append

    # output the final post-processed results.
    -args WriteLast
    -exit

    Nothing else in the script file will be read by the "imagemagick" command
    as such this could be a documentation area.

    =======8<--------

Example usage for a  "my_montage_script"...

   my_montage_script image1 image2 -append image3 output

This would produce an actual 'scripting' command of...

   /usr/bin/magick -script /path/to/montage_script \
            input1 input2 -append image3 output

And process the operations in this order (indent indicate processing depth)...
first indent is read from the script, the second processing of arguments.

   -script /path/to/montage_script
      -density 300
      -args Process
         -read "image_1"
         -read "image_2"
         -append
         -read "image_3"
      -frame 6x6+2+2 -border 2x2 -append
      -args WriteLast
         -write "output"
      -exit

Notes on the above...

I designed the argument handling so you can write scripts that can do things in
a "montage"-like  way.  That is process arguments like "convert" and THEN
finalise the processing of the images now in memory to produce the "montage"
output that is saved to the final arguement.

The script however may only only accept image filenames as arguments making any
'operations' an error.  Or perhaps only '-set' or '-define' like options
could be allowed (like "awk" command line variables).

Even the last argument filename may be treated as a read image, final save
image, or even as a single image read and write (like a simple "mogrify").

Basically I am trying to make scripting as versatile as possible but without
making it a full scripting language.

-----------
Use of '--' in scripts...

This special option will allow user supplied options to be grouped into
'stages' for processing at specific points in the script.  for example..

   montage '*.png' -- -frame 10x10+3+3 result.png

Anything before the '--' is processed to read-in the images, then at the '--'
the "montage" script will take those images and tile, lable, frame, shadow,
and finally position and merged the images together into a paged grid layout.

After that the next set of user supplied options (if any) will be performed,
so the montaged image is 'framed' before being saved into 'result.png'

QUESTION: use of -script in the user supplied arguments?


FUTURE DIRECTION...

Handling 'per image' options ... that is one image in memory being processed
as in "mogrify" ???

   mogrify  {setup_options} -- {per-image processing} -- {images to process}

Something to read one image from final group?
per-image processing can be a user supplied script?

-----------

Demonic pipeline example (heavy shell scripting)...

The IM command is run in background and the options feed to the script as
needed and calculated, based on feed back.  This is probably a little
simplistic, but should be posible.

  =======8<--------

  #!/bin/bash
  # start co-process for image processing
  coproc magick -script -
  IM_pid=$COPROC_PID    # the Process ID of the imagemagick co-process
  IM_out=${COPROC[0]}   # file descriptor IM writes to (and this script reads)
  IM_in=${COPROC[1]}    # file descriptor IM reads (and this script write to)

  # create an image and 'identify' it.
  echo >$IM_in  "xc: -identify"

  # read the single line of identify results from above
  read -r <$IM_out identify_output

  # kill co-process (no write so junk images in memory)
  echo >$IM_in "-exit"
  # wait for co-process to exit (not really needed).
  wait $IM_pid

  =======8<--------

Basically you have a "magick" command running in background.  This
'co-process' reads in the images, and performs any tasks requested of it by
the parent shell script (or any other programming language).

The parent shell can ask it for information about images being held, have it
read in more images, or save out images to whereever you want, at any time.

The tasks are not fixed and can be decided by the parent shell based in that
shells input options, or information returned from the "imagemagick"
co-process, or even from other sources.

This is highly efficent as you only need to run "imagemagick" once and images
only need to be read in once.  No need for pipelines or saving of intermediate
images to disk.

The parent shell process can do all conditional IF-THEN-ELSE constructs and
even do looped processing of operations, simply and easilly.

The calling structure can be simplified by using functional wrappers around
the image processing requests.

In PHP you would use the  proc_open()  function.

  =======8<--------
  <?php

  // Launch imagemagick co-process
  $IM_cmd = 'magick -script -';
  $descriptorspec = array(
     0 => array("pipe", "r"),     // stdin (feed image processing options)
     1 => array("pipe", "w"),     // stdout (for results)
     2 => array("file", "/tmp/im-errors.txt", "a") // stderr
  );
  $IM = proc_open($IM_cmd, $descriptorspec, $pipes, NULL, $_ENV);
  if (!(is_resource($IM)) {
    echo "ERROR: Failed to launch \"imagemagick\" command";
    die();
  }
  stream_set_block($pipes[2], 0);   // set non-blocking

  // Any error reports during launch (say from the shell?)
  if ( $err = stream_get_contents($pipes[2])) {
    echo $err;
    die();
  }

  // Make image processing requests
  fwrite($pipes[0], "-read image.gif\n"); // read in this image
  fwrite($pipes[0], "-identify\n");       // identify it
  fflush($pipes[0]);                      // ensure buffer is sent

  $identify = fgets($pipes[1], 1024);     // get the -identify result

  print "$identify";                      // print it to stdout

  // Clean up and exit
  fwrite($pipes[0], "-exit\n");           // ask co-processor to exit
  fclose($pipes[0]);

  // Get any error reports during launch (say from the shell?)
  if ( $err = stream_get_contents($pipes[2])) {
    echo $err;
    die();
  }

  ?>
  =======8<--------

In this form of control the wrapping script (or compiled language) becomes
a true 'wrapper' around that single image processor, simplifying things to
a point where you simply feed it image processing commands, at any time in the
shell script.  The shell or PHP wrapper in this case provides all the control
and looping structures needed, allowing IM to concentrate on holding images in
memory and processing them!

The Imagemagick co-process itself does not even need to be on the same
machine, allowing you to generating image processing farms!

This is actually taking a old forum discussion topic to a new level
See   https://magick.imagemagick.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=13100

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scripting will need a major expansion in percent escape handling...

See Proposal...
  http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/bugs/IMv7_FX_and_Percent.html

THIS HAS BEEN DONE (except in %[fx..] and other planned special escapes)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scripting methods for multiple images...

Adding text to video frames?
    https://magick.imagemagick.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=18983&p=73784

Of course looping through images, using one command per image is probably the
easiest to implement.

One method of looping over a large number of images, as a 'image stream',
without saving intermeditae images, was demonstrated in another similar
discussion.  However the images are streams using ASCII PPM file format.
  https://magick.imagemagick.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=18320&p=71150
and resulting in the script
  http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/scripts/process_ppm_pipeline

But these methods require you to constantly start (fork) a separate process or
command for each image.  That is you would be starting a new process and
initializing (setup) the core library once for each image, which can be
in-efficent.

That is you can not relate the image processing with what has been already
been done before.

At this time you can only truely avoid forking a "convert" command multiple
times by using some other non-shell API, so that the library only is configured
once.  Then have it read, process, write and destory (remove from memory) each
frame in turn.

In shell scripts you can minimise startup time by processing images using
mogrify which reads and processes one of the given image file at a time.
Mogrify works by cycling though the non-image command line options once for
each image.
     http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/basics/#mogrify

That however is limited, it is hard to modify the arguments being used for each
image (say for the credit string and its position).  You also can not easily
compose or merge two or more images onto each frame.

You can also read a small batch of images, say 10 to 50 frames (depending on
memory) using convert, and a technique for using the input filename to set the
output filename of each image.  See "Using Convert Instead of Morgify"
  http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/basics/#mogrify_convert
Which may be useful for say a static credit on N frames, then a different
credit for the next N frames and so on.

You can also generate a very long convert command that reads, processes, and
writes (deleting from memory) one image at a time.  This lets you use one
command, but apply different operations for each image (say drawing scrolling
credits, or adding a side animation that is common on modern movies).

For example
  convert \
     ... \
    "f_0053.png" -annotate +10+30 "Scroll" -write  "new_0053.png" +delete \
    "f_0054.png" -annotate +10+27 "Scroll" -write  "new_0054.png" +delete \
    "f_0055.png" -annotate +10+24 "Scroll" -write  "new_0055.png" +delete \
    ... \
    null:[/code]

It is a most versatile and efficient technique, as you don't have to fork,
setup, or re-read secondary images  over and over.

At any one time, only one image is being processed in memory, but only one
one command processing all the images.  The technqiue also allows you to be
free to completely switch processing to completely different tasks.

For example you can have a extra image in memory with each frame (in turn).
Such as one very long static credit image that you can then overlay on your
smaller video frame, at different offsets so as to generate a long sequence of
scrolling text over the top of your video.

The limitation with this is at the length of the command line!  Not all shells
will having a command line longer than one to two thousand characters (bash
seems to handle extremely long command lines though).

The above scripting proposals will take this to a new level. That is...
Image co-processing,  or image pipeline processing, with feedback.
